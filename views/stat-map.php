                This is an individual academic project which I was to utilize multiple APIs to make 
                an application of my choice. I chose to make an interactive map where a user can 
                click and see information about the country they clicked on and the current weather 
                in the nearest city. This could help people when they're traveling especially once I add things 
                like which language is predominantly spoken in an area or which currency they use.

                I started out by ensuring I was able to get the information I wanted from the APIs, so I implemented text 
                search that would make a call to the weather API and the country statistics API based on what was entered. Once I got that working, I integrated
                the map and began working on being able to drop a pin to get location information. I used a package called 
                google-maps-react (linked to on the GitHub of this project) to display the map. Reading the documentation 
                I figured out how to add markers to the map and get the latitude and longitude from a placed marker. After that 
                it was a matter of translating the latitude and longitude to a city and country key value pairs. For this I used Googleâ€™s
                Geocode API which gives the country and city name so I can use it to get information from the other two APIs used.
