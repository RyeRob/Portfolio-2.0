                This is an individual academic project which I was to utilize multiple APIs to make 
                an application of my choice. I chose to make an interactive map where a user can 
                click and see information about the country they clicked on and the current weather 
                in the nearest city.

            <ul>
                <li>React.js and ES6 basics</li>
                <li>How to work with API's and JSON data</li>
                <li>Intergrating open source projects into my own projects</li>
            </ul>

                I started out by ensuring I was able to get the information I wanted from the APIs, so I implemented text 
                search functionality. This was to test the API calls I was making. After I got this working, I integrated
                the map and began working on being able to drop a pin to get location information. I used a package called 
                google-maps-react (linked to on the GitHub of this project) to display the map. Going through the documentation 
                I figured out how to add markers to the map and get the latitude and longitude from the placed marker. After that 
                it was a matter of translating the latitude and longitude to a city and country name pair. For this I used Googleâ€™s
                Geocode API which then passes the country and city name to the other APIs to get the weather of the nearest city and
                statistics for that country.
