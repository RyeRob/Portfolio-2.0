                GlobalMedic was looking to make their website easier navigate for visitors and more straightforward 
                to update for staff. Their old website was overloaded with plugins that were slowing it down and causing accessibility issues.
                After working with staff to finalize the design I created a custom WordPress theme for their site with customizer integration and 
                page templates to allow them to have control over their whole site.

                I made multiple mockups for this project and made changes with feedback from the staff at GlobalMedic. Below is the final desktop version of 
                the mockup which I used Adobe Photoshop to create. I also made a mobile version of the mockup with a working menu in Adobe XD which can be found at
